## Project Description 
In this project we are searching for ore bodies with high concentrations of Nickel and Cobalt (used to make EV batteries).
## Workflow 
1) Cleaning the very messy dataset
2) Plot the geochemistry data using geopandas and comparing the statistical distribution of these elements across two lithologies: gabbro and basalt.
3) Answering the question: which lithology has better prospects?
## Discussion 
Viewing the data with geopandas visualizations, as well as on my [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cecylia.fortunska/viz/MinnesotaMiningProspects/NickelColbatProspects) dashboard we can see the Gabbro is the much better prospect.
