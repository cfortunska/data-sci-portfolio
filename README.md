# Data Science Portfolio 
Collection of projects completed for hobby, self-learning, and academic purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
 
 ## Instructions 
 To run the Jupyter notebooks use the Jupyter notebook server, as usual.
 
 ## Personal Projects 
 [Machine Learning - Speeding Dating - Is it a Perfect Match?](https://github.com/cfortunska/data-sci-portfolio/tree/main/ML%20Speed%20Dating)  
 A model to predict whether two people are a match during a series of speed dating events. Identified traits that were most important to people when deciding whether they would like to match with someone. 
  
 [Natural Language Processing - Wine Recommender - Wine Around the World]( https://github.com/cfortunska/data-sci-portfolio/tree/main/Wine%20Recommender)  
 Used NLP to create a wine recommender, based off wine descriptions written by tasters, of the top ten wines that are similar to your favorite wines. You can also find a dashboard I created in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cecylia.fortunska/viz/WineAroundtheWorld/WineAroundtheWorld) of top 50 wines under 20 dollars, top 50 wines in general, what regions have the most expensive wine, and which regions score the most points.
 
 [Web Scrapping - Yelp - Houston Venues - Where Do Couples Go Out?](https://github.com/cfortunska/data-sci-portfolio/tree/main/Yelp%20Web%20Scraping)  
 Scrapped data from yelp searching for Houston venues that couples consider 'romantic'. Also created a dashboard of all venue locations in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cecylia.fortunska/viz/Houston_restaurants/WhereDoCouplesGoonDatesinHouston).   
 
 ## Academic Micro Projects 
 
[Machine Learning - Comparing Cosmetics by Ingredients](https://github.com/cfortunska/data-sci-portfolio/tree/main/Cosmetics%20t-SNE)  
Processed ingredient lists for cosmetics on Sephora then visualized similarity using t-SNE and Bokeh. 
 
[A/B Test - Mobile Game Customer Retention](https://github.com/cfortunska/data-sci-portfolio/tree/main/AB%20Testing%20Mobile%20Game)  
Analyzed results of an A/B Test on a popular game called Cookie Cat. Once customers encounter certain gates they need to either wait a certain amount of time or pay to continue right away. Analyzed the impact of player retention. 
 
[Statistics - Disney Movie Success](https://github.com/cfortunska/data-sci-portfolio/tree/main/Disney%20Movie%20Success)  
Explored Disney movie data, then built a linear regression model to predict box office success. 
 
[Natural Language Processing - Movie Similarities](https://github.com/cfortunska/data-sci-portfolio/tree/main/NLP%20Movie%20Similarities)  
Used NLP and clustering on movie plot summaries from IMDb and Wikipedia to quantify movie similarity. 
 
[Data Visualization - Google Search Trends](https://github.com/cfortunska/data-sci-portfolio/tree/main/Google%20Search%20Trends)  
Manipulated and plotted time series data from Google Trends to analyze changes in search interest over time.
